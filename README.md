# React pokemons

This is a simple project that i used to learn about react library

## Technologies

`pnpm`  
`Vite`  
`React`  
`Typescript`  
`Recoil`

## Goals

For me main aim was to:

- Learn syntax of react components
- Learn how to pass props, handle events in react
- Master reactive dependancies (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Use Component nesting (`PokemonCards`, `PokemonCompareTable`)
- Handle state between multiple pages (i used `Recoil` because it was simpler than `Redux`)
- Do some DOM manipulations (`~/utils/ElementFixer`, `~/components/Header`)

All the above was used in this project.

## Versions

`node` - 16.17.1
`npm` - 8.15.0  
`pnpm` - 7.26.0

All other version dependancies is provided are `package.json`

## Extra

This project was build in about 8 work days but since I was doing that in my free of work time. It took a while to finish. Although I could've used more time to master some tricky things about react my main goal was to learn react basics and a little extra, so there is not going to be some extremely optimized codebase. But I am pretty happy with the result.

This project doesn't have real backend, but I've implemented some asynchronous functions to try to modulate real life experience working with promises.

As of time I started this project I had more than 3 years of experience in web development and about 2 years in `Vue.js`

If you have read this far I wanna say thank you for sharing your time and have a good day!
