# React pokemons

This is a simple project that i used to learn about react library

## Technologies

`pnpm`  
`Vite`  
`React`  
`typescript`  
`recoil`

## Goals

For me goal main aim was to:

- Learn syntax of react components
- Passing props, handling events in react
- Reactive dependencies (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Components nesting (`PokemonCards`, `PokemonCompareTable`)
- Managing state (i used `Recoil` because it was simpler than `Redux`)
- DOM manipulations (`~/utils/ElementFixer`, `~/components/Header`)

All the above was used in this project.

## Versions

`npm` - 8.15.0  
`pnpm` - 7.26.0

All other version dependancies is provided in `package.json`
